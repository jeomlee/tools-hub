      <h2>Privacy & file handling</h2>
      <p class="small">
        Many tools on this site run locally in your browser. That means your files can be processed on your device
        without being uploaded to a server. When a tool requires file handling, the design goal is to avoid storing
        files and to minimize any data collection.
      </p>

        Mini Tools Hub is maintained as a small independent web service. New tools may be added over time,
        and existing tools may be improved for better performance and compatibility.
